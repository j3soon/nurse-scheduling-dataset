# The First International Nurse Rostering Competition

Files downloaded from the official site: https://nrpcompetition.kuleuven-kulak.be/

Paper link: https://www.patatconference.org/patat2010/proceedings/3_9.pdf

Instances and solutions are missing from the official site, collected from:

- https://github.com/lab-core/NurseScheduler/tree/master/datasets/INRC
- https://github.com/chgogos/INRC1/tree/master/datasets
- https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-optaplanner/tree/main/optaplanner-examples/data/nurserostering/import

Note that there are some discrepancies between the data above. The `lab-core/NurseScheduler` are correct but missing toy examples. The `chgogos/INRC1` includes toy examples but has incorrect `long_late04.xml`. The `apache/incubator-kie-optaplanner` seems to have modified the instances, so we do not include their files. We still keep its link here for reference.
