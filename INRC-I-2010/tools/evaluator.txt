the command can be run as follows:
	java -jar evaluator.jar [options] schedulingperiod.xml solution.xml

example: java -jar evaluator.jar -p toy1.xml toy1_sol.xml

Make sure evaluator.jar is in the CLASSPATH.

Options are:
	-h	prints help information about the use of the evaluator
	-p	option only to print the value of the objective function without the violations per employee
	
When no option is given, the evaluator gives as output
	- a representation of the solution
	- an overview of the violations of the solution per employee

For each violation, the value of the violation and the position (timeunit) where the violation occurs is given.
	e.g. Maximum number of consecutive working days: 2 - pos: 20
		means that an employee is working two days more than 
		the number of maximum allowed consecutive working days. 
		The series of consecutive working days ends at time unit 20.
